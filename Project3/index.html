        <h2 id="Michael Jordan"><b>Why is Michael Jordan the GOAT?</b></h2>
    
        <p>There are many reasons why His Airness is considered the GOAT, but it's his impeccable<br>
            track record for winning championships that carries his legacy over the top.<br>
            As one player who participated in the poll explained, if he were to choose a single<br>
            player to win a game, he would pick Jordan without a doubt.

    <h2 id="LeBron James"><b>The Legacy of LeBron James</b></h2>

    <p>Standing 6-9 and weighing north of 250 pounds with a 40-inch vertical, James' game<br>
        is built on power, but his passing ability might be his strongest skill.<br>
        The four-time MVP and three-time champion has reinvented how an athlete's prime should be viewed;<br>
        he had the Lakers in the thick of a title hunt as a 35-year-old playing in his 17th season.<br>
        His chase-down block in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals to help complete a 3-1 comeback against a Warriors<br>
        team that won 73 games will forever encapsulate his will to win.</p>

    <h2 id="Kobe Bryant"><b>The Black Mamba- Kobe Bryant</b></h2>

    <p>For all of his statistical achievements -- the five championships, the 81-point game, the
        <br>60-point finale, the league MVP in 2008, the 20 seasons all with the same franchise --<br>
        Bryant's lasting legacy is his mental edge and burning desire to master the sport.<br>
        "Mamba mentality" became more than a kitschy catchphrase after Bryant died; it is now a blueprint<br>
        for how to chase your dreams. He'll forever be on the short list of players you'd want to take the<br>
        last shot with the game on the line.
